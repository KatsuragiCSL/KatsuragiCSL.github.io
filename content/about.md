I am [Jack Chan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jack-shue-long-chan/), with a fancy online name `KatsuragiCSL` as  the "social norm" is apparently that you need a fancy nickname online if you post nerdy things online. 

This blog is a place for me to share what I learnt, what I experimented, occationally shitposting and some "tutorial series" that are unlikely to be finished. 

Potential original thoughts are in research section. Other categories are for things I found beautiful.
