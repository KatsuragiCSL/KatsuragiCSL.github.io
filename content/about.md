I am Chan Shue Long, you can also call me Jack, which is a made-up name just like many asians do when they assimilate the "western" circles. Or your can call me with my online name `KatsuragiCSL` as the "social norm" is apparently that you need a fancy nickname if you post nerdy things online. ~~Maybe Chan Shue Long is not my real name too, who knows.~~

This blog is a place for me to share what I learnt, what deeply moved me (and not too annoying to write a blog post for it, apparently.). And occationally shitposting and some "tutorials" that are unlikely to be finished.
