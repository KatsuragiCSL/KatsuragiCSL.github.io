I am Chan Shue Long, you can also call me Jack, which is a made-up name just like many asians do when they assimilate the "western" circles.

Mathematics is my first love. I am also into computer science, philosophy, chinese literatures and sports. I ended up working in security industry and I also love it - to explore the "applied" side of things.

This blog is a place for me to share what I learnt, what wheels I reinvented and what deeply moved me. And occationally shitposting and some "tutorials" that are unlikely to be finished.
