This post also talks about some social dynamics, especially about conflicts, but not necessarily related to ethics.

### Exploiting the difference in time costs is a well-known trick...for a special case

Same amount of time does not cost everyone the same. We all know that, especially good negotiators: 

But if we look at the more general case, as long as there are significant gap between the time costs of two players, it could be exploited. The time pressure in negotiation is a special case of time cost differentials in which the time cost of at least one of the players is like:

### Low time cost != poor

Indeed poverty could cause lower time cost, but not always, and a person has lower time cost does not imply that he is poorer.

In daily life, there are a few examples of people with relatively low time cost who are not poor:
1. Old people
2. Owners of stable business (in contrast to, say, small business, or quickly expanding/shrinking businesses, in which the owner has many things to take care of)
3. 9-5 workers in a gov job

The case of old people is ironic. 

The 9-5 gov job workers 

### People exploit time cost differentials without knowing (or do they?)

asd

### Okay, will all the problems be solved if we don't allow people with different time costs interact?
