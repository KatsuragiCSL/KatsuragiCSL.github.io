      <title>Centrality: how we actually perceive the severity of a bug</title>

      <description>An empty business lingo or a good quantification? We hope to, and probably need to, quantify the severity of security bugs. The “need” mainly comes from the fact that we have to provide an interface to management: We need to have a reasonably objective quantification to tell how serious an issue is (and show that we would not overplay/downplay something for our own self-interest), and that would lay the groundwork for the establishment of a bug handling standard that the engineering team would follow.</description>

      <description>Disclaimer: The author&amp;rsquo;s knowledge about the legal system by no means applies to anywhere outside of his homeland. But what is legal or illegal should be similar enough for the discussion below - at least for first world countries, I guess.
That said, the author is not a lawyer and does not have accurate knowledge of any concrete laws. But one does not need to know (too many of) them for this article.</description>
