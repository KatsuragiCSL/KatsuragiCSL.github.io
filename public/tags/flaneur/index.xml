      <description>This is somewhat a sequel of the previous post about the game played between the jerks and the normal people. This post also talks about some social dynamics, especially about conflicts, but not necessarily related to ethics. The order of sections in this post does not follow a strict waterfall model. It is not like a story telling or trying to prove some points by gradually elaborating it. It consists of a few thoughts that I had related to the same topic, hence some sections might look like standalone.</description>

      <title>Our legal (and moral) system flavors the jerks</title>

      <description>Disclaimer: The author&amp;rsquo;s knowledge about the legal system by no means applies to anywhere outside of his homeland. But what is legal or illegal should be similar enough for the discussion below - at least for first world countries, I guess.
That said, the author is not a lawyer and does not have accurate knowledge of any concrete laws. But one does not need to know (too many of) them for this article.</description>
