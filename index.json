[{"content":"My pc is overheated how do i cool it down because it is my life1 Someone said that chatGPT will replace Google. Some kids/ early teenagers do often ask chatGPT for things that could have been found by Googling.\nI really hate the idea of replacing search engines by chatGPT. The problem I have with it is not really about AI, but about how do we interact with it.\nWhen we were kids and learnt how to use search engines, we acquired the skills of capturing important parts of the questions in our minds and turn them into keywords. Bashing questions like \u0026ldquo;my hard disk is full how can I get more space\u0026rdquo; usually get worse results than things like \u0026ldquo;hard disk space full solutions\u0026rdquo; as their counterparts.\nSame thing applies to going to library and look for related books in the old days: you can\u0026rsquo;t expect to see there is a book titled almost the same as your question, you have to look for the suitable subject and go to the corr. book shelves, look for keywords and sometimes even look for keywords that is a superset of the things you want and hopefully get the answer in one of the chapters. I speculate that this process is important for training our abstraction ability.\nBut the chatGPT allows people to input their braindump like casually talking and get the answer.\nOf cause, one can still train abstraction ability by something else, like in the older days when there were no search engines, even no internet. But if you know how to search, in most cases it would be faster and you will get more firm answers. And I hate the (bad type of) laziness shown when some people keep bashing long stupid questions into chatGPT and satisfied by shallow answers.\nWe all do this, but in other situations I recently learnt the concepts of complementary cognitive artifacts and competitive cognitive artifacts from David Krakauer: https://nautil.us/will-ai-harm-us-better-to-ask-how-well-reckon-with-our-hybrid-nature-236098/ . You can think of them as a fancier way to say things that help you but make you dumb and those don\u0026rsquo;t. Competitiv cognitive artifacts aren\u0026rsquo;t always bad. Calculators are competitiv cognitive artifacts with respect to the ability of doing arithmetics manually. But do I care being bad at it? No. Is it important in general? Meh, most huamn beings don\u0026rsquo;t need to be good at arithmetics (as long as not bad enough to think 1+1=3 and grab 3 items in a buy-one-get-one-free sale and argue with the cashier). But the fluency of turning a question into something that can be googled reflects a basic level of abstraction as a thinking/ problem solving skill.\nWell, the plot twist is, chatGPT fans can argue: \u0026ldquo;You can throw a question or even an article and ask chatGPT to extract the keywords for you!\u0026rdquo;. But I don\u0026rsquo;t think human beings can outsource thinking to machines.\nFirst, for aesthetic reason, the effort of understanding the world and the insights and wisdom gain by ourselves are what makes our lives worth as human beings. Just getting the answer means nothing.\nMoreover, if the service is provided by someone else, namely big techs at this moment, it is possible that it is not a \u0026ldquo;pure\u0026rdquo; LLM, it can be poisoned by artificial (as in artificial intelligence, lol) regulations. lcamtuf talked about this. Imagine a world in where people all believes the standards and decisions from a inhuman intelligent system which is actually just humans like in Psycho-Pass.\nFinal rant Maybe I am too unreconstructed for this generation, but I think we are entering the age of impatience and chatGPT is just yet another product which encourages the culture of impatience.\nFrom https://www.rebootonline.com/blog/men-bing-from-mars-women-google-from-venus/.

I took a look on some reference but found that the setup can be a bit frustrating. This post is attempting to make the setup clearer and more followable.

It is written in C#. We need the below tools:\ndnSpy dotPeek (patched) de4dot Some files from official Unity Setup If you got a DEBUG build of the game, you are lucky, you can skip almost all the steps below and just use dnSpy to decompile, debug and modify the code (discussed below). But if you are not insider of the game development team and the team is not stupid enough (or, unfortunately, didn\u0026rsquo;t get enough sleep) to release a debug build to production, you will be dealing with a RELEASE build.\nFortunately, there is a way to tweak the release build to debug build.\nStep 1 Check the version of Unity of the game. Open the file \u0026lt;game root folder\u0026gt;\\\u0026lt;game name\u0026gt;_Data\\globalgamemanagers.assets with notepad, the version of Unity will be shown at the beginning.\nStep 2 Go to https://unity.com/releases/editor/archive and download the correct version of Unity. Install it.\nStep 3 Go to \u0026lt;Unity root\u0026gt;\\Editor\\Data\\PlaybackEngines\\windowsstandalonesupport\\Variations\\win32_development_mono if the game is 32bit, otherwise go to \u0026lt;Unity root\u0026gt;\\Editor\\Data\\PlaybackEngines\\windowsstandalonesupport\\Variations\\win64_development_mono.\nCopy Data\\Managed folder to the corr. folder of the game. Copy WindowsPlayer.exe and UnityPlayer.dll. Rename to \u0026lt;GAME_NAME\u0026gt;.exe.

Create of edit boot.config and ensure the line player-connection-debug=1 presents. Step 4 Download this de4dot fork and compile it locally by Visual Studio.\nStep 5 Run de4dot.exe -f Assembly-CSharp.dll -o \u0026lt;output dll location\u0026gt; -fpdb. Remove the output pdb file.\nStep 6 Load the output dll into dotPeek.\nRight click on the output dll and select Export to Project Check the box Create *.pdb file Export Step 7 Run the following command: \u0026quot;%UNITY_MONO%\\bin\\mono.exe\u0026quot; \u0026quot;%UNITY_MONO%\\lib\\mono\\4.5\\pdb2mdb.exe\u0026quot; \u0026quot;\u0026lt;target_assembly_dll\u0026gt;\u0026quot; where \u0026quot;%UNITY_MONO% is equal to \u0026lt;Unity root\u0026gt;\\Editor\\Data\\MonoBleedingEdge.\nYou will get a .mdb file.

This issue has been reported to Palo Alto as security disclosure, however Palo Alto declared that this is an expected behavior.\nWhile Palo Alto seems not considering it as a problem, I think it is at least a trick for post exploitation. Below is some background knowledge.\nPrisma Cloud Prisma Cloud is a cloud security solution developed by Palo Alto, providing features including monitoring processes in standalone hosts/ run as daemon set in a K8S cluster.\nThis is done by deploying an agent (which is called a defender) in the target host.\nTo do so, one needs permissions to Prisma Cloud in order to get an access token. Defender Manager is the most suitable role for an operator whose manager only wants him to help deploying defenders without letting him/ her know other information, for example monitoring rules.\nDigging the hole host Let\u0026rsquo;s get a Defender Manager role and install a host defender on a linux machine, let\u0026rsquo;s say machine A.\nTake a look at the directory /var/lib/twistlock/local_db/local/\u0026lt;version number\u0026gt;/messages/, connect is a big file containing a lot of configs, while some details are stored in other files in the same directory.\nWhy can I view things that has nothing to do with my host? Other assets like container registries /var/lib/twistlock/local_db/local/\u0026lt;version number\u0026gt;/connect\nFirewall rules that belongs to OTHER hosts /var/lib/twistlock/local_db/local/\u0026lt;version number\u0026gt;/hostAppFirewallPolicy\nContent of custom rules (e.g. process/ network monitoring) /var/lib/twistlock/local_db/local/\u0026lt;version number\u0026gt;/updateCustomRule\nAs a Defender Manager, all you are supposed to have is the root access in the host where the defender to be installed on. However, after installing defenders, you will be able to get information much more than just the info of that host. For example, reading custom rules on other hosts, let say, hosts which are more important and you don\u0026rsquo;t want to get caught when you have the chance to access them.\nThose could help you if you are an internal threat of a company which uses Prisma Cloud but don\u0026rsquo;t know this trick :)\n","permalink":"https://katsuragicsl.github.io/blogs/post-exploitation/prisma-cloud-defenders/","summary":"Tl;dr - unfixed information disclosure in Prisma Cloud defenders This post is about how to abuse a agent of a cloud security solution to get information which you should not know, like what security controls are applied, what assets the victim owns and the owners of the assets.\nIntroduction A few months ago I was examining the Prisma Cloud configuration of my workplace and accidentally discovered an information disclosure issue of Prisma Cloud defender (the agent).","title":"Prisma Cloud Defenders"}]
